Here's a basic template for your frontend README file, tailored to your project, which seems to be related to role-based access control (RBAC) in a UI:
# RBAC UI - Frontend
This is the frontend for the Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system built using React. The project allows users to log in, view different roles, and access features based on their permissions. It integrates with the backend for authentication, authorization, and role-based access control.

- Integration with backend APIs for role management.

## Technologies
- **React** - Frontend framework for building the UI.
- **Redux** - State management for handling user roles and permissions.
- **React Router** - For routing and navigation between different sections of the app.
- **Material-UI** - UI component library for a clean and responsive design.
- **Axios** - For making API requests to the backend.
- **JWT** - For handling authentication and storing tokens securely.
